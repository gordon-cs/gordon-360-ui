	Overview
		The current method of entering hours for on 			campus jobs is very outdated and inefficient, the 			goal of this project is to modernize it and move 			it to 360.gordon.edu
	Problem Statement
		Chris Carlson and Chris Hansen want to replace 			go.gordon.edu with 360.gordon.edu. This project 		will be a major step towards achieving that goal. 			Currently the system to enter one’s hours is very 			outdated and it makes it difficult to enter one’s 			hours in an efficient manner. The goal is to have 			a system that works more efficiently so that 			students will not complain about it as much. 			Currently the system requires students to scroll 			through a list of every minute in the day and 			select the minute at the start and end of their 		shift. This value defaults to the current minute 			no matter what. This is one of many problems with 			the current system. We all believe that this 			system could be improved in a number of ways such 			as being able to set shifts that you work 			regularly and continually change the date. The 			Chris’s are very excited to work with us to solve 			this problem, and we all seem to be on the same 		page about it.
	Customer Maintenance Capability
		In the future the 360 team would be in charge of 			maintaining this project.
