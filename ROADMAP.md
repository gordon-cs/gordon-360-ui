# Roadmap

This document describes the work required to bring the React rewrite of Gordon 360 to feature parity with the current EmberJS version of Gordon 360.

Each top-level item in the list may have:

* a checkbox that should be checked off when the item is complete (required)
* a short description of the item (required)
* a link to an existing page that the item refers to
* components that the item can be broken down into
* improvements over the existing implementation that can be made when building the item
* unknowns that must be addressed before starting work on the item

To check off items on the list, open `ROADMAP.md` in your editor and place an `x` in between the brackets like `[x]`.
