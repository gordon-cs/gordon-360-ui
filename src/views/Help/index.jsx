                    <strong>Do I have to rejoin an Involvement each semester?</strong> Yes. This
                    allows each student to control their participation in Involvements for their
                    Experience Transcript. Student Leaders and Advisors can ADD members and guests
                    too! Some may do this to help maintain their team roster.

                      What&apos;s the difference between subscribing to, and joining an Involvement?{' '}
                    </strong>
                    Subscribing to an Involvement allows you to receive emails from the Involvement,
                    but not to view other members of the Involvement. Joining a Involvement means
                    you're an active member of the Involvement. You can view other members in the
                    Involvement in addition to getting group emails.

                  <li>
                    <strong>What if I leave an Involvement?</strong> Subscribership and Membership
                    are fluid during an academic session, and are confirmed at the conclusion of a
                    session. You can come and go over the semester, and your Membership will move to
                    your official Experience Transcript only at the end of the semester.

                    </strong>
                    No problem. Contact the Involvement leaders or advisor and they will be able to
                    remove you from the list.
