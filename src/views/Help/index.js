                <strong>Do I have to rejoin an Involvement each semester?</strong> Yes. This allows
                each student to control their inclusion in Involvements for their Co-Curricular
                Transcript. Student Leaders and Advisors can ADD members and guests, too, and some
                may do this to help maintain their team roster.

                  What&apos;s the difference between subscribing to, and joining an Involvement?{' '}
                </strong>
                Subscribing to an Involvement allows you to receive emails from the Involvement, but
                not to view other members of the Involvement. Joining a Involvement means you're a
                member of the Involvement, and can view other members in the Involvement, in
                addition to getting emails.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>What if I leave an Involvement?</strong> Subscribership and Membership are
                fluid during an academic session, and are confirmed at the conclusion of a session.
                You can come and go over the semester, and your Membership will move to your
                official Co-Curricular Transcript only at the end of the semester.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>What if I am in an Involvement I don&apos;t want to be part of? </strong>
                No problem. Contact the Involvement leaders or advisor.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>
                  I&apos;m an alumna or alumnus. Why do I not see the join button anymore?{' '}
                </strong>
                Sorry, but alumni cannot join new Involvements. You could still subscribe to
                Involvements to receive emails!
