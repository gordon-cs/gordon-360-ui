          Apartments provide an alternative to the traditional residence hall setting and offer a
          unique community experience. To be eligible to live in an apartment, students must be at
          least 20 years old as of Sept. 1, {thisYear} <strong>or</strong> have junior or senior
          academic standing. Students who were on disciplinary probation at any time during the{' '}
          {thisYear - 1}-{thisYear} academic year must also receive approval from the Dean of
          Student Life or the Assistant Dean of Student Life to be eligible to apply for an
          apartment. Each applicant must be registered as a full-time student by{' '}
          {apartmentSelectionDate}.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          Each group of students desiring to live in a Tavilla or Bromley apartment or in The
          Village must submit an application. Your application can include a student who is studying
          abroad or not enrolled for the Spring {thisYear} semester &ndash; simply list their name
          on the application.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          <strong>Full-time, off-campus program credit:</strong> Students fulfilling academic
          program requirements through student teaching or a full-time internship will qualify for
          the full-time, off-campus program credit. It is the responsibility of applicants to claim
          this credit on the application.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          <strong>Applications must be for a full apartment:</strong> If applying for a six-person
          apartment, there must be six people on the application who will be here for the{' '}
          <strong className={styles.over_emphasized}>fall semester</strong> (four people on a
          four-person application, etc.). Applications with an incorrect number of applicants will
          not be considered.

          <strong>An application is not a guarantee!</strong>
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          Due to the large number of applications typically received for apartments, not all
          applications will be awarded an apartment. If you do not receive an apartment, you will
          need to secure housing through the housing lottery.

          <strong>How are apartments awarded?</strong>
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          Apartments are awarded in order of point total for each type of apartment (4-person,
          6-person, etc.). Each individual on an application will have points given/taken away using
          the following scale:

          You will be notified of your placement in an apartment/Village{' '}
