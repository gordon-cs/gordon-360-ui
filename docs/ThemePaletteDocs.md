Project Overview
--

As part of an ongoing effort to consolidate the code base, and centralize the way we do styling, we
are tackling this project to respond to several problems.

- Many components use extensive in-line styling, leading to repeated styles and a frustrating
  experience updating styling.
- There is a lack of standardization in styling, with many components partially using CSS, and
  partially in-line styles, and different ways of doing colors.
- There has been a desire to implement a dark mode theme, which is not feasible with the way we
  currently implement colors.
- Colors were not centralized, with some in `src/_vars.scss` and others in `src/theme.ts` used in
  different places.
- The recent brand refresh necessitated updating certain colors and components, which gave us a good
  opportunity to rethink/refactor the way we do styling throughout the project.

#### For these reasons we decided to tackle a couple of related projects:

- Create palettes of all the gordon colors in `src/theme.ts` for light and dark modes using the
  `extendTheme` API (replacing the old `createTheme` API)
- Replace the old `ThemeProvider` with the `Experimental_CssVarsProvider` in
  `src/components/providers`
- Go through all components and convert in-line style to CSS where possible to centralize and clean
  up styling
- Modify CSS to reference the new theme CSS variables provided by the `CssVarsProvider`, replacing
  the old SASS variables defined within `src/_vars.scss`
- Deprecate the GordonColors defined in `src/theme.ts`, which will be replaced by the new theme
  palettes.

Throughout this project, we were loosely followed the steps described in the MUI
[migration guide](https://mui.com/material-ui/experimental-api/css-theme-variables/migration/).

### Changes

#### Theme Variables

theme.ts now defines two palettes (light and dark) within a theme object using the extendTheme API.
This theme is then passed to the `Experimental_CssVarsProvider` in src/components/providers, which
makes the themes accessible throughout the project via React context.
[CssVarsProvider Docs](https://mui.com/material-ui/experimental-api/css-theme-variables/overview/)

The theme is defined in the following object structure:

```
colorSchemes: {
  light: {
    palette: {
      ...
    },
  },
  dark: {
    palette: {
      ...
    },
  },
},
```

Which is accessible using the CSS variable `--mui-palette` which will take on the value of light or
dark palette depending on which is set(see Setting the Theme below).

Within each palette there are a variety of colors, the names of which come from the Palette
interface defined in mui/material/styles. By default this includes the colors `primary`,
`secondary`, `error`, `warning`, `info`, and `success`, and each of these can have `main`, `dark`,
and `light`, shades, as well as shade colors 50-900 and accent colors A100-A700. We also extend the
default palette interface within theme.ts to add a neutral color, which can contain the same shades
as the primary color. [Palette Docs](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/palette/)

- [Getting Started](#getting-started)
These palettes can also be used to override the default MUI colors for certain MUI components that
don't reference the colors defined above, like cards, switches, etc. (Some MUI components reference
the colors described above by default). For example, the color `--mui-palette-background-paper` is
used by MUI cards.

These colors can then be referenced using CSS variables, i.e. `var(--mui-palette-primary-main)` or
`var(--mui-palette-neutral-400)` from within CSS class in .scss files.

#### Setting the Theme

For testing we made a component that defines a button to switch pallete modes (light, dark) with the
`useColorScheme()` hook. This sets the scheme globally, changing the color scheme of `--mui`
throughout the project.

## Guide for Future Developers

###### After this project is completed, there are a few notes and best practices that future developers should follow.

#### Dark Mode

The most important thing for UI development is testing how every component appears in dark mode, 
with proper contrast, colors, etc.

#### In-Line Coloring

Many MUI components can reference the palette colors without the use of CSS.  For example, buttons, 
headers, typography and others have a `color` prop.  A button with the prop `color='primary'` will 
have a GordonBlue background and White text color based on the main and contrast text colors defined 
in the primary colors.  Where possible, you should use the color prop instead of external CSS unless 
further customization is needed.

#### Colors

All colors should reference a color from the palette, and consideration should be given for a 
switch to dark mode.  Usage of theme variables in CSS looks something like this: 
`color: var(--mui-palette-primary-main)` or `background-color: var(--mui-palette-neutral-300)`.  
If you do need in-line styling within javascript, you can reference the --mui var, but you must wrap the 
whole color in quotes, ex: `style = { background: 'var(--mui-palette-success-dark)' }`, but again, 
this is undesirable if CSS is possible.  You can find examples of usage of these --mui theme variables
throughout the code.

If you need a new color, on top of those that already exist, you can add it to the palette in an 
open space (for example info.light is unused currently).  You should also name every color with 
a variable name in theme.ts to enhance readability.  In most cases though, you should use an
existing color from the palette.

#### Styling with CSS

All other styling and style overrides should be done in separate CSS classes if possible/practical.  In general, 
this means that colors, padding, and other styling properties should be defined in a CSS class and used 
in a component using the className prop (See MUI/CSS/SCSS documentation).  This should be done instead of 
using `style=...` or `sx=...` props inside of components (replace with the `className=...` prop).  
The only exceptions to this is if styling is done dynamically with some computation.  For example 
the Clifton Strengths colored ring around the profile photo, or the sizing of the photo cropper 
for involvements and profile photos, or in specific cases where the color isn't meant to change.

#### Adding new CSS Files

Gordon 360 uses CSS modules, written in SASS, which are specific to the folder they are in. As part 
of our project to remove in-line styling where possible, we created many new CSS files.

To create a new CSS for a component, create a new file in the enclosing folder called something like
`componentName.module.scss`, and create whatever CSS classes you want. This will create a SASS
file, (so you can make use of the extra functionality SASS includes), and will also generate two
files for you which convert SASS to CSS. Then, within your component's index file, add the
following line:

```
import styles from ./componentName.module.css // import module.css NOT module.scss
```
(Note: Must import the css since react components only understand CSS syntax, not SASS syntax)
